## Review of Oregon Trail by Landon Vernon

1. I chose to play Oregon trail for this journal

2. While i never played the Oregon trail as a kid, i did play the Organ Trail which was a remake of the original game but with zombies instead.
   I played Oregon trail for about an hour or so and I didnt think I was going to have as much fun as i did. The whole concept of the game is simple
   but keeps you engaged with small/large risks that could potentially pay off big or make your situation worse, which is a mechanic I really enjoy.
   Some games you come across something that endangers your group and if the wrong choice is made you'd just go back to a checkpoint, but in this you
   dont have that luxury, so your forced to live with the consequences and adapt.

3. What makes Orgeon trail a serious game are the choices, dangers and group management mechanics. For example, on my first run of the game I came across a river
   and tried to cross it, the game said the river was 600 feet across and like 4.5 feet deep so i thought to myself, oh this shouldnt be to bad. My driver died
   and i lost almost all my food within the first 24 hours of traveling, this really made me rethink my strategies and how I judge each subsequent danger. As i pressed on
   night came and i decided to camp out and wait for morning, and in the morning, one of my guys died to typhoid. This game doesnt take its survival lightly and literally
   anything from a broken foot all the way to dysentery can end a characters life in just a matter of hours/days. You really have to keep up on your group management and status
   or else no one is going to make it

5. A way to maybe allow people to find other ways around the river besides a ferry or fording the river, is to allow them to talk to people near the river
   and that person could have a small chance to tell you about a shallower part of the river upstream, it would take longer but it would be safer. Another
   one would allow you to send a scout ahead of the caravan to find potential dangers and ways around them.
